# Rewind

A social media platform for music lovers to connect and interact!

Music is an integral part of our lives today. Everyone from teengers to older people enjoy listening to music while working or traveling or doing any other activity. We even have many platforms for streaming music individually.
But what if there was a dedicated platform for music lovers to connect and share music with each other? It definitely will be a treat for them!
The proposed social platform is aimed to fulfil the very same purpose and access a wide range of other features. It will be connected to Spotify, allowing users to play music in real-time, and retrieve user profile details and sync it with the same.
The stakeholders of this project include the end-users, which are music lovers, and the business profile of the platform will generate revenue through advertisements, sponsored content, and premium subscriptions.
The existing music-based social platforms have limited features for user interactions and less personalized user experience. The aim of the platform is to specifically address that problem.

# Project Scope

The proposed social platform is implemented keeping in mind the lack of opportunities for the music-loving community to exchange their views and ideas over a platform specially dedicated to the music community.
The proposed web-based social platform will be heavily dependent on the data provided by Spotify, including user profile information and music streaming capabilities
It will also have some AI based features like recommendation systems, tagline generator,voice bot, etc. to improve the user experience.
The primary target audience for this project is the young adults across the country who are a greater part of users on the music streaming platform, Spotify. The platform will be designed & developed by keeping them in mind.

# Tech

● The proposed social media platform will be developed as a user-friendly website that can handle a large number of concurrent users.

● The platform will be heavily dependent on the data provided by Spotify, including real-time music streaming capabilities and user profile details which will be retrieved by integrating the platform with Spotify’s API.

● Features like AI-powered recommendation system, voice bot, and tagline generator will be implemented to enhance user experience.

● After reviewing the various technologies, the plan is to use the MERN stack with NextJS as the React framework to build the social platform.
